\end{center}

\section*{Development}
This project is open-source. We have received extensive help and advice from Stan's development team, as well as insightful feedbacks from the broader Stan community. We are active contributors to Stan's core language, and our focus is on tools for differential equations based models, with the goal to support applications in pharmacometrics. Metrum Research Group's collaboration with Columbia University for the development of tools for \textit{Fast and Flexible Differential Equation Model Fitting with Application to Pharmacometrics} is supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer grant from the Office of Naval Research.

\subsection*{Licensing}

\section{Introduction}
Metrum Research Group has developed a prototype Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model library for use in Stan 2.12. The current version includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specific linear compartmental models:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item One compartment model with first order absorption
    \item Two compartment model with elimination from and first order absorption into central compartment
  \end{itemize}
  \item General linear compartmental model described by a matrix exponential
  \item General compartmental model described by a system of first order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
\end{itemize}

The models and data format are based on NONMEM\textregistered\footnote{NONMEM\textregistered\ is licensed and distributed by ICON Development Solutions.}/NMTRAN/PREDPP conventions including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recursive calculation of model predictions
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This permits piecewise constant covariate values
  \end{itemize}
  \item Bolus or constant rate inputs into any compartment
  \item Handles single dose and multiple dose histories
  \item Handles steady-state dosing histories for specific and general \underline{linear} models
  \item Implemented NMTRAN data items include: TIME, EVID, CMT, AMT, RATE, ADDL, II, SS
\end{itemize}
This library provides Stan language functions that calculate amounts in each compartment.
    
\subsection*{Implementation details}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stan (\url http://mc-stan.org/) \cite{stan}
  \item All functions are programmed in C++ and are compatible with the Stan-math autodiff library
  \item All functions can be called directly in a Stan file in a manner identical to other built-in functions
  \item One and two compartment models: coded analytical caclulations
  \item General linear compartment models with semi-analytical solutions using built-in (still in development) Matrix Exponential function (Pade approximation coupled with scaling and squaring \cite{matrixExp})
  \item General compartment models with numerical solutions to ODEs using built-in ODE integrators in Stan (Runge-Kutta 4th/5th and CVODES), with adjustable tuning parameters
\end{itemize}

\begin{fmpage}{\textwidth}
{\bf WARNING:} The current version of Torsten is a {\em prototype}. It is being released for review and comment, and to support limited research applications. It has not been rigorously tested and should not be used for critical applications without further testing or cross-checking by comparison with other methods. 
\end{fmpage}


\subsection*{Development plans} Our current plans for future development of Torsten include the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A system to easily share packages of Stan functions (written in C++ or in the Stan language)
  \item Extend formal tests
  \begin{itemize}
    \item C++ Google unit tests
    \item Comparison with simulations from the R package \textit{mrgsolve}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Steady state calculation for the General compartment model
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This will require the developer of a solver for nonlinear algebraic equations (aka root solver)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Allow user to provide time-varying constant rate matrix in \texttt{linCptModel}
  \item Optimize Matrix exponential functions
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Function for action of Matrix Exponential on a vector
    \item Coded gradients
    \item Special algorithm for matrices with special properties
  \end{itemize}
  \item Google C++ unit tests
  \item R tests comparing simulations with the R package \textit{mrgsolve}
  \item Conduct beta testing
\end{itemize}

\section{Using Torsten}

In this section we go through the different functions Torsten adds to Stan. It will be helpful to apply these functions to a simple example.

\subsection*{Example 1: Two Compartment Model}
We modeled drug absorption in a single patient and simulated plasma drug concentrations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Single Dose: 5000 mg
  \item PK: plasma concentration of parent drug ($c$)
  \item PK measured at 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 hours after dosing
\end{itemize}

The plasma concentration ($c$) were simulated according to the following equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\log\left(c\right) &\sim& N\left(\log\left(\widehat{c}\right),\sigma^2\right) \\
 \widehat{c} &=& f_{2cpt}\left(t, CL, Q, V_2, V_3, k_a\right) \\
  \left(CL, Q, V_2, V_3, ka\right) &=& 
	\left(5\ {\rm L/h}, 8\  {\rm L/h}, 20\  {\rm L},  70\ {\rm L}, 1.2\ {\rm h^{-1}} \right) \\
  \sigma &=& 0.05
\end{eqnarray*}

The data are generated using the R package \textit{mrgsolve}, see \texttt{TwoCptModelSimulation.R}. We show the results obtained when using the function \texttt{PKModelTwoCpt}, which computes solutions to the ODEs analytically.

\subsection*{Linear One and Two Compartment Model}

The one and two compartment model functions have the form: \\

\texttt{<model name>(theta, time, amt, rate, ii, evid, cmt, addl, ss)} \\

where \texttt{time, amt, rate, ii} are arrays of real and \texttt{evid, cmt, addl, ss} arrays of integers. All arrays have the same length, which corresponds to the number of events. \texttt{theta}, also known as the \textit{parameter matrix}, is an array of vectors. If the parameters are constant for all events, \texttt{theta} should be an array of length 1, else its length should be the number of events. In the latter case, the \textit{ith} row contains a vector parameters for the time interval [\texttt{time[i-1], time[i]}].

The options for \textit{model name} are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item PKModelOneCpt
  \item PKModelTwoCpt
\end{itemize}
which respectively correspond to the one and two compartment model with first order absorption (see figure 1). A vector in \texttt{thetha} is expected to contain parameters $CL$, $V2$, and $ka$ for the one compartment case, and $CL$, $Q$, $V2$, $V3$, and $ka$ for the two compartments case, \underline{in this order}, followed by the bioavailability fraction of each compartment (non-effective if set to 1) and the lag time in each compartment (non-effective if set to 0). Note that setting $ka$ to 0 eliminates the fist-order absoprtion.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{One and two compartment models with first order absorption implemented in Torsten.}
\label{cptModels}
\end{figure}

\texttt{PKModelTwoCpt} can be used to fit example 1, see \texttt{TwoCptModelExample.stan}. Four MCMC chains of 2000 iterations were simulated. The first 1000 iteration of each chain were discarded. Thus 1000 MCMC samples were used for the subsequent analyses.

\textbf{Result.} The MCMC history plots (Figure 3) suggest that the 4 chains have converged to common distributions for all of the key model parameters. The  fit to the plasma concentration data (Figure 5) are in close agreement with the data, which is not surprising since the fitted model is identical to the one used to simulate the data. Similarly the parameter estimates summarized in Table 1 are consistent with the values used for simulation.

\subsection*{General Linear Compartment Model}
A general linear compartment model refers to a model that may be described in terms of a system of first order linear differential equations with (piecewise) constant coefficients, i.e., a differential equation of the form:
$$ x^\prime\left(t\right) = Kx\left(t\right) $$
where $K$ is a matrix. For example $K$ for a two compartment model with first order absorption is:
$$   K = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
	-k_a & 0 & 0 \\
	k_a & -\left(k_{10} + k_{12}\right) & k_{21} \\
	0 & k_{12} & -k_{21}
	\end{array}\right] $$ \\
where $k_{10} = CL / V2 $, $ k_{12} = Q / V2 $, and $k_{21} = Q / V2 $.

The linear compartment model has the form:

\texttt{linCptModel(K, theta, time, amt, rate, ii, evid, cmt, addl, ss)}

where \texttt{K} is the matrix describing the ODE system. Since most of the parameters appear in \texttt{K}, it is not necessary to specify them again in \texttt{theta}. Instead, we only specify in \texttt{theta} parameters left out of \texttt{K}, namely the bioavailability fractions and the lag times.

\subsection*{General Compartment Model}

Torsten may be used to fit models described by a system of first-order ODEs, i.e., differential equations of the form:
$$ x^\prime\left(t\right) = f\left(t, x\left(t\right)\right) $$
where $x$ and $f$ are vector-valued functions.

The general compartment model functions have the form:

\texttt{<model\_name>(ODE\_system, nCmt, \\
                              theta, time, amt, rate, ii, evid, cmt, addl, ss, \\
                              rel\_tol, abs\_tol, max\_step)}
                              
where \texttt{ODE\_system} is a system of first-order ODEs defined in the function block of Stan (see section 19.2 of the Stan reference manual) and \texttt{nCmt} is the number of compartments in the model. \texttt{rel\_tol}, \texttt{abs\_tol}, and \texttt{max\_step} are the tuning parameters for the ODE integrator, respectively the relative tolerance, the absolute tolerance, and the maximum number of steps. It is difficult to recommend values for the tuning parameters, though the authors typically use $rel\_tol = 1e-8$, $abs\_tol = 1e-8$ and $max\_step = 1e+8$. For more details see Stan's reference manual.

The options for \texttt{model\_name} are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item generalCptModel\_rk45
  \item generalCptModel\_CVODES
\end{itemize}

They respectively call the built-in Runge-Kutta 4th/5th integrator, recommended for non-stiff ODEs, and CVODES integrator, recommended for stiff ODEs.

Table 2 summarizes how to call Torsten functions.

It is key to understand which type of models each function works for, and which method optimizes model fitting. An analytical method will always be fastest, but only applies to a few simple cases. Numerical methods that use an ODE integrator are generally applicable, but are orders of magnitude slower. The matrix exponential solution falls, speed-wise, between the analytical and the numerical solution, and can be used for all linear ODEs system. 


\section{Additional Example}

\subsection*{Example 2: Effect Compartment Model}
We now expand example 1 to a population model fitted to the combined data from phase I and phase IIa studies. The parameters exhibit inter-individual variations (IIV), due to both random effects and to the patients' body weight, treated as a covariate and denoted $bw$:

\subsubsection*{Population Model for Plasma Drug Concentration ($c$)}
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \log\left(c_{ij}\right) &\sim& N\left(\log\left(\widehat{c}_{ij}\right),\sigma^2\right) \\
 \widehat{c}_{ij} &=& f_{2cpt}\left(t_{ij},D_j,\tau_j,CL_j,Q_j,V_{1j},V_{2j},k_{aj}\right) \\
 \log\left(CL_j,Q_j,V_{ssj},k_{aj}\right) &\sim&
   \lefteqn{N\left(\log\left(\widehat{CL}\left(\frac{bw_j}{70}\right)^{0.75},\widehat{Q}\left(\frac{bw_j}{70}\right)^{0.75},
	\widehat{V}_{ss}\left(\frac{bw_j}{70}\right),\widehat{k}_a\right),\Omega\right)} \\
 V_{1j} &=& f_{V_1}V_{ssj} \ \ \ \ \ \ V_{2j} = \left(1 - f_{V_1}\right)V_{ssj} \\
 \left(\widehat{CL},\widehat{Q},\widehat{V}_{ss},\widehat{k}_a, f_{V_1}\right) &=& 
	\left(10\ {\rm L/h},15\  {\rm L/h},140\  {\rm L},2\ {\rm h^{-1}}, 0.25 \right) \\
\Omega &=& \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 0.25^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.25^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0.25^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.25^2  \end{array}\right), \ \ \ \sigma = 0.1 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Furthermore we add a fourth compartment in which we measure a PD effect (see figure 8).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width=3.5in,trim=0in 0in 0 0in]{graphics/effectCptModel.pdf}
\caption{Effect Compartment Model}
\label{effCptModel}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Effect Compartment Model for PD response ($R$)}
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_{ij} &\sim& N\left(\widehat{R}_{ij},\sigma_{R}^2\right) \\
\widehat{R}_{ij} &=& \frac{E_{max}c_{eij}}{EC_{50j} + c_{eij}} \\
c_{e\cdot j}^\prime &=& k_{e0j}\left(c_{\cdot j} - c_{e\cdot j}\right) \\
\log\left(EC_{50j}, k_{e0j}\right) &\sim& N\left(\log\left(\widehat{EC}_{50}, \widehat{k}_{e0}\right),\Omega_R\right) \\
\left(E_{max}, \widehat{EC}_{50},\widehat{k}_{e0}\right) &=& \left(100, 100.7, 1\right) \\
\Omega_R &=& \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0.2^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.25^2  \end{array}\right), \ \ \ \sigma_R = 10
\end{eqnarray*}

The PK and the PD data are simulated using the following treatment.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Phase I study
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Single dose and multiple doses
    \item Parallel dose escalation design
    \item 25 subjects per dose
    \item Single doses: 1.25, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg 
    \item PK: plasma concentration of parent drug ($c$)
    \item PD response: Emax function of effect compartment concentration ($R$)
    \item PK and PD measured at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours
  \end{itemize}
  \item Phase IIa trial in patients
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 100 subjects
    \item Multiple doses: 20 mg
    \item sparse PK and PD data (3-6 samples per patient)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The model is now simultaneously fitted to the PK and the PD data! For this four compartment model, we construct a constant rate matrix and use \texttt{linCptModel}. Correct use of Torsten requires that the user pass the entire event history (observation and dosing events) for an individual to the function. Thus the Stan model shows the call to \texttt{linCptModel} within a loop over the individual subjects rather than over the individual observations.

\subsubsection*{Results} We use the same diagnosis tools as for the previous example. The MCMC history plots (Figure 10) suggest the 4 chains have converge to common distributions. We note some minor auto-correlations for $lp\_$ (the log posterior) and for IIV parameters: specifically $\Omega_{ke\_0}$ and $\rho$. The correlation matrix $\rho$ does not explicitly appear in the model, but it is used to construct $\Omega$, which parametrizes the PK IIV. The fits to the plasma concentration  (Figure 12) are in close agreement with the data, notably for the sparse data case (phase IIa study). The fits to the PD data (figure 13) look good, though the data is more noisy. The model reflects the noise by producing larger confidence intervals. The estimated values of the parameters are consistent with the values used to simulate the data.

\subsection*{Friberg-Karlsson Semi-Mechanistic Model \cite{2364}}

In this third example, we deal with a more sophisticated PD effect, described by a system of nonlinear ODEs. The PK effects are still described by a two compartment model with a first-order absorption. 

Neutropenia is observed in patients receiving an ME-2 drug. Our goal is to model the relation between neutrophil counts and drug exposure. Using a feedback mechanism, the body maintains the number of neutrophils at a baseline value (see figure 14). While in the patient's blood, the drug impedes the production of neutrophils. As a result, the neutrophil count goes down, and after  the drug clears out, the feedback mechanism kicks in and brings the neutrophil count back to baseline.

\subsection*{Friberg-Karlsson Model for drug-induced myelosuppression ($ANC$)}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\log(ANC_{ij}) &\sim& N(Circ_{ij}, \sigma^2_{ANC}) \\
\log\left(MTT_j, Circ_{0j}, \alpha_j\right) &\sim& N\left(\log\left(\widehat{MTT}, \widehat{Circ_0}, \widehat{\alpha}\right), \Omega_{ANC}\right) \\
\left(\widehat{MTT}, \widehat{Circ}_0,\widehat{\alpha}, \gamma \right) &=& \left(125, 5, 2, 0.17\right) \\
\Omega_{ANC} &=& \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 0.2^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.35^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0.2^2 \end{array}\right), \ \ \ \sigma_{ANC} = 0.1 \\

\label{FK}
\end{figure}

The PK and the PD data are simulated using the following treatment.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Phase IIa trial in patients
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple doses: 80,000 mg
    \item Parallel dose escalation design
    \item 15 subjects
    \item PK: plasma concentration of parent drug ($c$)
    \item PD response: Neutrophil count ($ANC$)
    \item PK measured at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours
    \item PD measured once every two days for 28 days.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Once again, we simultaneously fit the model to the PK and the PD data. From a computational perspective, this is a much more difficult problem than the one we dealt with in previous examples. The nonlinear nature of the ODEs forces us to use a numerical solver, which is significantly slower than the linear methods we have employed so far. Because the ODE system of interest is non-stiff, we use the \textit{rk45} version of \texttt{genCptModel}.

It pays off to construct informative priors. For instance, we could fit the PK data first, as was done in  example 1, and get informative priors on the PK parameters. The PD parameters are drug independent, so we can use information from the neutropenia literature. In this example, we choose to use weakly informative priors on the PK parameters and strongly informative priors on the PD parameters. 

Since it takes a long time to run the model, we only use 100 iterations per chain, and study what we can learn from this less than optimal scenario. It is worth noting that Stan, because of its highly efficient MCMC sampler, still does a reasonable job estimating the posterior distribution.

\subsubsection*{Results} The MCMC history plots are not as convincing as in the previous examples, mostly because the number of iterations is small (100 versus 1000 in the previous example). It does however look as though the chains are converging to a common distribution, and we see little auto-correlation (in particular, we  expect that if we had run the model for 1000 iterations, we would obtain the desired "fuzzy caterpillar" look). The plots of the marginal posterior distributions clearly show that the chains have not (yet) converged to a common distribution, but they do not disagree significantly. Still, the need for more iterations is evident. The model fits the data, and the confidence interval reflect the noise in the data. The parameters estimation are actually pretty good.

\section{Under the Hood Design}
We here discuss some background theory and the design of Torsten at a C++ level.

Our approach is heavily based on the \textit{BUGS model library}, a prototype PKPD model library for WinBUGS (\url{https://bitbucket.org/metrumrg/ bugsmodellibrary/wiki/Home}), developed by Metrum Research Group in 2009.

This section is intended for developers. No knowledge of C++ is required for users.


\subsection*{Computing Amounts in an ODE-based model}
Most PKPD model are based on ODEs that describe how PK and PD amounts evolve over time. For instance, the following ODEs describe drug diffusion in a one compartment model with a first-order absorption from the gut:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dGUT}{dt} &=& -kaGUT \\ 
\frac{dCENT}{dt} &=& kaGUT - \frac{CL}{V_{1}}CENT
\end{eqnarray*}

If the ODEs fully describe the PKPD system, knowing the state $y_0$ at time $t_0$ fully defines the solution at finite times. Exploiting this property, Torsten calculates the evolution of amounts in each compartment from one event to the other. The initial conditions of the ODE system are specified by the previous event, and the ODEs are integrated from $t_{previous} $ to $t_{current}$. 

Note we cannot simply integrate from $t_{first}$ to $t_{last}$ because the ODEs do not describe exterior interventions, such as additional dosing. Torsten treats these interventions independently. Most importantly, Torsten only integrates between $t_0$ and $t_1$ if no exterior interventions occur during this interval. To achieve this, it is key to properly handle the \textit{event schedule}. 

All five functions in Torsten call the C++ function \texttt{pred}, which:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item augments the event schedule to include all events that alter the system
  \item calculates the amounts in each compartment at each event of the augmented schedule
  \begin{itemize}
    \item computes the \textit{natural} evolution of the system by integrating ODEs
    \item computes alterations due to exterior interventions
  \end{itemize}
  \item returns the amounts at each event of the original schedule
\end{enumerate}

The Event Schedule depends on the user's input (TIME, EVID, CMT, AMT, RATE, ADDL, II, SS). The event schedule may need to be augmented if, for example, an event specifies a patient receives multiple doses at a regular time interval. Consider: \\

\texttt{TIME = 0, EVID = 1, CMT = 1, AMT = 1500, RATE = 0, ADDL = 4, II = 10, SS = 0} \\

This Event specifies that a time 0 (TIME = 0), a patient receives a 1500 mg (AMT = 1500) drug dose (EVID = 1) in the gut (CMT = 1), and will receive an additional dose every 10 hours (II = 10) until the patient has received a total of 5 doses (ADDL = 4, being the number of additional doses, + 1, the original dose). Such an Event really corresponds to 5 dosing events.

To integrate the ODEs, \texttt{pred} calls \texttt{pred1} (prediction for one event) or \texttt{predSS} (prediction for one event if the system is in a steady state, i.e SS = 1). \texttt{pred1} and \texttt{predSS} are functors and get constructed differently by each Torsten function. Under \texttt{PKModelOneCpt}, \texttt{pred1} analytically computes the solution, while under \texttt{generalCptModel\_rk45} it numerically solves the ODEs.
 
\subsection*{Structure of a Torsten Function} 
Under the structural scheme described above, a Torsten function performs a very simple set of actions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consistent with Stan practices, check the validity of the arguments and of the parameter values
  \item Construct the PKModel object, which contains basic information about the model, such as the number of compartments
  \item Construct the pred1 and predSS functions
  \item Call pred
\end{enumerate}  

Figure 14 shows the C++ code for \texttt{PKModelOneCpt}.

\subsection*{Implementing Torsten in Stan}
\subsubsection*{Modifications in Stan-math}
All five Torsten functions are located under the \texttt{Torsten} directory, under \texttt{stan/math}. We modified \texttt{rev/math} to include the \texttt{torsten/torsten.hpp} header file. The code can be found on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/charlesm93/math} 

\subsubsection*{Modifications in Stan}
Further modification are done in Stan to expose the Torsten functions to the Stan language. We edited \texttt{function\_signatures.h} to expose \texttt{PKModelOneCpt}, \texttt{PKModelTwoCpt}, and \texttt{linCptModel}. The general compartment model functions are higher-order functions in that they take another function as one of their arguments. They were exposed by directly modifying the grammar files, following very closely the example of \texttt{integrate\_ode\_rk45} and \texttt{integrate\_ode\_bdf}.

The code can be found on GitHub:  \url{https://github.com/charlesm93/stan}
