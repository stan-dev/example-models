# Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (by John K. Kruschke)

Models from the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (2014) by John Kruschke).

Original JAGS code and data files are available at the [book's website](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/).

Stan translations were done by [Gianluca Rossi](https://github.com/IamGianluca). I want to thank John K. Kruschke for permitting to publish the Stan translated models.
